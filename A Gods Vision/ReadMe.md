A gods vision was a project created quite a long time ago. 
Inspired by the very old game Populous the game was intended to be a Game where the player watches over a Civilisation as it grows through all ages. With abilities to influence and guide your civilisation to prosperity. The finished game was supposed to include Multiplayer and support time from the bronze age to modern. 

Ofc this was a waay to ambitious project. I realized this during the development of the terrain engine and gave up.
